## Mod Functionalities
The mod includes the following functionalities:

1. **New Blocks**: The mod introduces a new custom blocks to the game called "Totem of Undeath". This block can be obtained by crafting with 2 wither skeleton skulls, 2 warped wooden planks, 2 essence of undeath and finally, the NecroPilalger's head. It's sole purpose is to spawn 2 iron golems each time the player right clicks the block. The totem has a "capacity" of 100, and each time the golems are spawned, the capacity goes down by 25, after that, it breaks. However, it can be "charged" by using the essence of undeath, which increases its current capacity by 10.

2. **New Items**: New items are added to the game, either as drops from the Necro Pillager, or by killing certain mobs. These items can have special abilities, effects, or uses that differ from the default items in Minecraft.

3. **New Mobs**: The mod introduces new mobs, creatures, or entities to the game. These can be hostile or friendly and interact with the player and the environment in various ways. They may have unique behaviors, drop items, or offer challenges for the player.

4. **Gameplay Enhancements**: The mod enhances the gameplay experience by introducing new mechanics, features, or systems. These can include things like new crafting recipes, smelting options, enchantments, or modifications to existing gameplay elements.

5. **Custom Biomes**: The mod adds new custom biomes to the Minecraft world. These biomes can have distinct terrain, vegetation, weather patterns, or other characteristics. Exploring these biomes can offer unique experiences for the player.
